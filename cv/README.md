## CV files

`Mishab_Abdurahman_CV_Enhanced.md` is an enhanced, impact-focused rewrite of your CV with **numeric placeholders** you can replace later.

### Placeholder guide (replace these with your real numbers)
- `[X]+ years`: total experience years (or years in sales/customer operations)
- `[X%]`: conversion rate, SLA compliance, accuracy improvement, response-time reduction, retention increase, etc.
- `[AED/OMR X]`: revenue, pipeline value, savings, or order value
- `[X requests/day]`, `[X orders/month]`: volume handled
- `[X hours/days]`: turnaround time targets
- `[CRM tool used]`: e.g., Salesforce, Zoho, Dynamics, Freshdesk, etc.
- `[add-link]`: LinkedIn profile URL

If you share 4–6 real metrics (volumes, SLAs, revenue, retention, savings), I can tighten the bullets further and place the numbers in the best-impact spots.
